Imagine you are a programmer creating static code analysis tool.
Generate function with prototype int cbc_crypt(char *key, char *data, unsigned datalen, unsigned mode, char *ivec), relying on the following static analysis rules which tell us what functions to use to mark the code as needed:
1. For any cryptography functions, e.g. crypt, setkey, password etc., use sf_password_use(<parameter>), where <parameter> is any function's char pointer except data parameter;

Consider that static code analysis functions perform all the necessary actions, you don't need to return or assign anything.

Also consider that we need this function only to mark the program and we the real function behavior is not needed.
