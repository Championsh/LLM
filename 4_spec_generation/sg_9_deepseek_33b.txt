Here is a possible implementation of the FreePages function based on the given rules:
Copy code

#include <stdint.h>

void FreePages(void *Buffer, uintptr_t Pages) {
    sf_delete(Buffer, PAGES_MEMORY_CATEGORY);
}

This function takes a pointer to a buffer and the number of pages to free as input, and uses the sf_delete function to mark the code as needing to free the specified memory. The PAGES_MEMORY_CATEGORY keyword is used to indicate that the memory being freed is in the "pages" category.

It's important to note that this function is only used for static code analysis and does not actually perform any memory freeing. The sf_delete function is a placeholder and should be replaced with the appropriate function for the specific memory management system being used.
