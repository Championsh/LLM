Imagine you are a programmer creating static code analysis tool.
Generate function with prototype public override int Read(char[] buffer, int index, int count), relying on an existing function public StringReader(string s):
public StringReader(string s)
{
    if (s == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException("s");
    _s = s;
    _length = s == null ? 0 : s.Length;
};
Consider to generate a lightweight code, i.e. we need only general function behaviour without assignment, we don't need cycles too.
