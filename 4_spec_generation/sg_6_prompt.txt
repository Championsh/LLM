Imagine you are a programmer creating static code analysis tool.
Generate function with prototype int isgraph(int c), relying on the following static analysis rules which tell us what functions to use to mark the code as needed:

2. For any value check functions, e.g. isalpha, islower etc., use sf_set_trusted_sink_char(<parameter>), return_PURE(<parameter>), where <parameter> is function's int parameter;

Consider that static code analysis functions perform all the necessary actions, you don't need to return or assign anything.

Also consider that we need this function only to mark the program and we the real function behavior is not needed.
