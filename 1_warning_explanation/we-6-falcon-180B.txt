Sure, the warning is saying that using user input from a TextBox control as the name of an object to be instantiated using reflection through the Activator.CreateInstance() method may have security risks. Reflection allows code to programmatically inspect and manipulate objects at runtime, which may lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if untrusted or malicious input is used. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid using user input directly in reflection operations and instead use safer alternatives like pre-defined type names or input validation.
