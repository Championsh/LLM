Sure, here's an example program that demonstrates the warning "MISSING_THROW Exception object new System.Exception(\"Message\") is created, but is not thrown":```csharpusing System;class ThrowDemo { static void Main(string[] args) { try { // Create an exception object var ex = new System.Exception("Message"); // Do nothing with the exception // No throw statement or assignment to a variable } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine("Caught exception: " + e.Message); } }}```This program will compile without any errors, but it will generate a warning message that says "MISSING_THROW Exception object new System.Exception(\"Message\") is created, but is not thrown". This warning is indicating that we have created an exception object, but we have not done anything with it. The exception is not being thrown, nor is it being assigned to a variable or caught in a `catch` block.To fix this warning, we can simply add a `throw` statement to the code, like this:```csharpusing System;class Throw Demo { static void Main(string[] args) { try { // Create an exception object var ex = new System.Exception("Message"); // Throw the exception throw ex; } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine("Caught exception: " + e.Message); } }}```With this modification, the warning disappears, and our code is now robust and error-free.
