Imagine you are a programmer creating static code analysis tool.
Generate function with prototype void FreePages(void *Buffer, uintptr_t Pages), relying on the following static analysis rules which tell us what functions to use to mark the code as needed:

4. For any page or pool free functions, e.g. FreeAlignedPages, FreePool etc., use sf_delete(<buffer>, <keyword>_MEMORY_CATEGORY);, where <buffer> is function's pointer parameter and <keyword> is a part of function's name, e.g. for FreeAlignedPages function the <keyword> is ALIGNED_PAGES, for FreePool function the <keyword> is POOL;

Consider that static code analysis functions perform all the necessary actions, you don't need to return or assign anything.

Also consider that we need this function only to mark the program and we the real function behavior is not needed.
