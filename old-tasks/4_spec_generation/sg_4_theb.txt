Sure! Here's a lightweight implementation of the SysReAllocString function based on the existing SysAllocString function:

c

int SysReAllocString(BSTR *pbstr, const OLECHAR *psz) {
    BSTR ptr = *pbstr;
    sf_copy_string(ptr, psz);
    return 0;
}

This implementation simply copies the content of the psz string to the existing pbstr BSTR pointer. The return value of 0 indicates that the function has completed successfully.

Please note that this is a simplified implementation and does not include error handling or memory allocation logic present in a real-world code analysis tool.
