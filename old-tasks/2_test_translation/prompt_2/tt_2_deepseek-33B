Here is the C++ version of the code. Note that C++ does not have the same concept of namespaces as C#, so I have removed it. Also, C++ does not have classes, so I have replaced the class with a struct.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct A
{
    int square(int x)
    {
        return x*x;
    }

    int example(int a, int b, int c, int x)
    {
        int result = 0;

        if (b != 0) // CSCC-TRACE{{Start of original code block}}
        {

            result = square(b) + square(x);
        }

        if (c != 0) // CSCC-TRACE{{Start of pasted copy}}
        {
            result = square(b) + square(x); // CSCC-WARN{{BAD_COPY_PASTE In the expression square(b) variable b possibly need to be replaced with c after copy paste}}
        }

        return result;
    }
};

int main()
{
    A a;
    std::cout << a.example(1, 2, 3, 4) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
