class Foo:

    def foo(self, n):
        i = 0
        sum = 0
        while i < n: # correct loop direction because decrementing is handled by python automatically 
            sum +=1
            i+=1


In this translated version, we use a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop since the loop variable (`i`) should be increased each iteration rather than decreased as it was in the original C# code. The loop condition also needed to be updated to reflect this change, so we used `i<n` instead of `i>0`. Additionally, we added an assignment statement inside the body of the loop to update the running total (`sum`). Finally, we made sure to handle the case where `n=0`, which would cause an infinite loop in the original code due to the incorrect loop direction.```
