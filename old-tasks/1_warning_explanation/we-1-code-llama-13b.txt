The reason why we recommend using CultureInfo as an explicit parameter instead of relying on implicit behavior from the current thread’s culture settings is because it ensures that your code will behave consistently across different environments and locales. For example, if a user runs your application in a French-speaking country where they have their computer set up with French regional settings, then “Hello” might be sorted differently than when run in an English speaking country even though both strings are identical. To avoid this issue, always pass a valid CultureInfo object whenever possible, especially when dealing with text data.
