Imagine you are a programmer creating static code analysis tool.
Generate function with prototype int xdecrypt(char *secret, char *passwd), relying on the following static analysis rules which tell us what functions to use to mark the code as needed:

1. For any cryptography functions, e.g. crypt, setkey, password etc., use sf_password_use(<parameter>) for each any char pointer parameter of function except data parameter

Consider that static code analysis functions perform all the necessary actions, you don't need to return or assign anything.
Also consider that we need these functions only to mark the program and we the real functions behavior is not needed.
Don't add implementation for any static code analysis functions, as they are defined in "specfunc.h" header.
