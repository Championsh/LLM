Imagine you are a programmer creating static code analysis tool.
Generate function with following exact prototypes int SSL_is_init_finished(const SSL *ssl), int X509_EXTENSION_get_critical(const X509_EXTENSION *ext), relying on the following static analysis rules which tell us what functions to use to mark the code as needed:

Memory Allocation and Reallocation Functions:
    Mark the input parameter specifying the allocation size with sf_set_trusted_sink_int.
    Create a pointer variable Res to hold the allocated/reallocated memory.
    Mark both Res and the memory it points to as overwritten using sf_overwrite.
    Mark the memory as newly allocated with a specific memory category using sf_new.
    Mark Res as possibly null using sf_set_possible_null.
    Mark Res as not acquired if it is equal to null using sf_not_acquire_if_eq.
    Set the buffer size limit based on the input parameter and the page size (if applicable) using sf_buf_size_limit.
    If the function copies a buffer to the allocated memory, mark the memory as copied from the input buffer using sf_bitcopy.
    For reallocation, mark the old buffer as freed with a specific memory category using sf_delete.
    Return Res as the allocated/reallocated memory.

Memory Free Function:
    Check if the buffer is null using sf_set_must_be_not_null(buffer, FREE_OF_NULL)Mark the input buffer as freed with a specific memory category using sf_delete(buffer, MALLOC_CATEGORY),
    sf_lib_arg_type(buffer, "MallocCategory")Memory Allocation Function for size parameter:
    sf_set_trusted_sink_int(size)sf_malloc_arg(size)void *ptrsf_overwrite(&ptr)sf_overwrite(ptr)sf_uncontrolled_ptr(ptr)sf_set_alloc_possible_null(ptr, size)sf_new(ptr, MALLOC_CATEGORY)sf_raw_new(ptr)sf_set_buf_size(ptr, size)sf_lib_arg_type(ptr, "MallocCategory")return ptrPassword Usage:
    Functions that take a password or key as an argument should be checked to ensure that the password/key is not hardcoded or stored in plaintext. Mark these arguments using sf_password_use.

Bit Initialization:
    Functions that initialize bits should be checked to ensure that they are properly initialized and used. Mark these arguments using sf_bitinit.

Password Setting:
    Functions that set a password should be checked to ensure that the password is properly set and used. Mark these arguments using sf_password_set.

Overwrite:
    Functions that overwrite data should be checked to ensure that the data is properly overwritten and not used after being overwritten. Mark these arguments using sf_overwrite.

Trusted Sink Pointer:
    Use sf_set_trusted_sink_ptr to mark a pointer as a trusted sink when it is passed to a function that is known to handle it safely.

String and Buffer Operations:
    Use sf_append_string, sf_null_terminated, sf_buf_overlap, sf_buf_copy, sf_buf_size_limit, sf_buf_size_limit_read, sf_buf_stop_at_null, sf_strlen, and sf_strdup_res to handle strings and buffers safely.

Error Handling:
    Check all functions for their return values and handle errors appropriately using sf_set_errno_if and sf_no_errno_if.

TOCTTOU Race Conditions:
    Check all functions that take file names or paths as arguments for TOCTTOU race conditions using sf_tocttou_check or sf_tocttou_access.

File Descriptor Validity:
    Check all functions that take file descriptors as arguments for their validity using sf_must_not_be_release, sf_set_must_be_positive, and sf_lib_arg_type.

Tainted Data:
    Mark all data that comes from user input or untrusted sources as tainted using sf_set_tainted.

Sensitive Data:
    Mark all sensitive data as password using sf_password_set.

Time:
    Mark all functions that deal with time as long time using sf_long_time.

File Offsets or Sizes:
    Limit the buffer size using sf_buf_size_limit and sf_buf_size_limit_read for all functions that deal with file offsets or sizes.

Program Termination:
    Use sf_terminate_path to terminate the program path in functions that do not return, such as _Exit, abort, and exit.

Library Argument Type:
    Use sf_lib_arg_type to specify the type of a library argument.

Null Checks:
    Use sf_set_must_be_not_null to specify that a certain argument or variable must not be null. Use sf_set_possible_null to specify that a certain argument or variable may be null.

Uncontrolled Pointers:
    Use sf_uncontrolled_ptr to mark a pointer that is not fully controlled by the program.

Possible Negative Values:
    Use sf_set_possible_negative to mark a variable that can potentially have a negative value.
Consider that static code analysis functions perform all the necessary actions, you don't need to return or assign anything.
Also consider that we need these functions only to mark the program and we the real functions behavior is not needed.
Don't add implementation for any static code analysis functions, as all functions and structures are defined in "specfunc.h" header.
