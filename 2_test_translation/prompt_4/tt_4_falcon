```C++
#include <iostream>

Point ConvertToPoint(Vector vector)
{
    return Point(vector.x, vector.y);
}

bool g(C* c)
{
    Vector* v = c->v;
    Point* pt = nullptr;
    try
    {
        pt = new Point(ConvertToPoint(*v)); 
    }
    catch (const std::exception& e)
    {
        std::cout << "Failed to convert vector to point; v.x = " << v->x << ", v.y = " << v->y << "\n";
        return false;
    }

    pt->x *= 2;
    pt->y *= 2;

    v->x = 5;
    v->y = 6;

    return true;
}

class Vector
{
public:
    int x, y;
};

class Point
{
public:
    int x, y;

    Point(int x, int y) : x(y), y(x) {}
};

class C
{
public:
    Vector* v;
};

int main()
{
    C c;
    c.v = new Vector();
    g(&c);
    delete c.v;
    return 0;
}```


This code creates a pointer to a C object and passes it to the function g(). Within the function, a null pointer pt is assigned to point to a Point object. This null pointer is then dereferenced when attempting to assign values to its member variables, which will cause undefined behavior.

Additionally, there is a potential memory leak as the dynamically allocated Point object is never deleted.
