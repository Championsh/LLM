Here's the given C# code translated to C++ while preserving the semantics and mistakes present in the code:

cpp
#include <iostream>

class A {
    int square(int x) {
        return x * x;
    }

    int example(int a, int b, int c, int x) {
        int result = 0;

        if (b != 0) { // CSCC-TRACE{{Start of original code block}}
            result = square(b) + square(x);
        }

        if (c != 0) { // CSCC-TRACE{{Start of pasted copy}}
            result = square(b) + square(x); // CSCC-WARN{{BAD_COPY_PASTE In the expression square(b) variable b possibly need to be replaced with c after copy paste}}
        }

        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    A obj;

    int a = 2;
    int b = 3;
    int c = 4;
    int x = 5;

    int result = obj.example(a, b, c, x);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
Note: The given C# code has been translated to C++ with the utmost care to maintain the original structure and mistakes. However, keep in mind that the mistakes present in the code, such as the bad copy-paste mistake, may still be there and can have unintended consequences. It's always recommended to review and rectify such mistakes for correct program behavior.
