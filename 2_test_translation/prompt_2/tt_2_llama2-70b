Here's the equivalent C++ code that demonstrates a bad copy-paste mistake:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int example(int a, int b, int c, int x) {
int result = 0;
    if (b != 0) { // CSCC-TRACE{{Start of original code block}}
    {
        result = square(b) + square(x);
    }
    if (c != 0) { // CSCC-TRACE{{Start of pasted copy}}
    {
        result = square(b) + square(x); // CSCC-WARN{{BAD_COPY_PASTE In the expression square(b) variable b possibly need to be replaced with c after copy paste}}
    }
    return result;
}
int main() {
    cout << "Welcome to our application!" << endl;
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    int c = 20;
    int x = 30;
    int result = example(a, b, c, x);
    cout << "Result: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this code, the `example` function takes four parameters: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x`. The function checks whether `b` or `c` is equal to zero, and performs different operations based on those conditions.
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `square` function is called with the wrong variable in the second `if` statement. Instead of using the variable `c`, the function uses the variable `b` again, which leads to incorrect results. This mistake was likely caused by copying and pasting code without properly adjusting the variables.
To fix this vulnerability, it's recommended to carefully review and test the code to ensure that all variables are used correctly and consistently throughout the program.





//////////////// That code won't compile due to excess curly brackets near comments. Here's new answer after a query "remove excess brackets from your code"

Sure, here's the updated code without excess brackets:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int square(int x) {
return x * x;
}
int example(int a, int b, int c, int x) {
int result = 0;
if (b != 0) {
result = square(b) + square(x);
}
if (c != 0) {
result = square(b) + square(x); // CSCC-WARN{{BAD_COPY_PASTE In the expression square(b) variable b possibly need to be replaced with c after copy paste}}
}
return result;
}
int main() {
cout << "Welcome to our application!" << endl;
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int c = 20;
int x = 30;
int result = example(a, b, c, x);
cout << "Result: " << result << endl;
return 0;
}
```
