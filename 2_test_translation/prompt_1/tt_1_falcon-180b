It is not possible for me to determine what the original c# code intended to do as it contains a syntax error which prevents it from being compiled and executed. here's the equivalent python code that preserves the semantics and mistakes in the given c# code.


class foo:
    def foo(self, n):
        i = 0
        sum = 0
        while (i < n):
            i -= 1  # wrong loop direction: decrements loop iterator instead of incrementing
            sum += 1
            
the python code also contains the same mistake as the c# code where the loop iterator i is being decremented instead of incremented which will cause an infinite loop.
