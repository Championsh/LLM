# Here's the Python code that demonstrates an infinite loop bug:

class Foo: 
    def foo(n): 
        i = 0 
        sum = 0 
        while i < n: # Wrong loop direction: the loop condition should be i >= n instead of i < n 
            sum += 1 
            i -= 1

'''This code creates a method called foo that takes an integer parameter n. The code then initializes two variables i and sum to zero. It then enters an infinite loop where it adds one to the variable sum each time through the loop and subtracts one from the variable i each time through the loop.

The problem with this code is that the loop condition is wrong. The condition should be i >= n instead of i < n because the loop decrements i each time through the loop, but the condition expects the value of i to increase. As a result, the loop will never exit and will keep running indefinitely, causing an infinite loop bug.'''
