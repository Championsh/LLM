Sure! Here's the equivalent Python code that demonstrates the same infinite loop bug:
'''python
class Foo:
    def foo(n):
        i = 0
        sum = 0
        while i < n:
            sum += 1
            i -= 1 # This line is equivalent to "i--" in C#
'''

In both codes, the loop invariant is `i < n`, but the loop increment operation `i-=` in C# or `i -= 1` in Python actually decreases the value of `i`, which means the loop will never terminate.
