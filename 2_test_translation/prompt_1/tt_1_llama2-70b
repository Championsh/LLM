Sure! Here's the equivalent Python code that demonstrates the same infinite loop bug:
```python
class Foo:
def foo(self, n):
i = 0
sum = 0
while i < n:
sum += 1
i -= 1 # Same mistake as in C# code, i.e., loop incrementor decreases the loop iterator variable i, but condition i < n expects the value of i to increase
```
Note that I've used a Python `while` loop instead of a `for` loop to translate the C# code directly. This is because the C# `for` loop is actually a shorthand for a `while` loop with a hidden iteration variable, and the mistake in the code is related to the update of the iteration variable.
In both languages, the mistake is that the loop incrementor (`-= 1` in Python or `--i` in C#) decreases the value of the loop iterator variable (`i`), but the loop condition (`i < n`) still expects the value of `i` to increase on each iteration. As a result, the loop never terminates, causing an infinite loop.
