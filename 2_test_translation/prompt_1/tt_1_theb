Here's the translation of the given C# code to Python, preserving the semantics and mistakes:

python
class Foo:
    def foo(self, n):
        i = 0
        sum = 0
        while i < n:  # Wrong loop direction: loop incrementor decreases the loop iterator variable i, but condition i < n expects the value of i to increase
            sum += 1
            i -= 1
Please note that the mistake present in the original C# code, where the loop incrementor decreases the loop iterator variable i, but the condition i < n expects the value of i to increase, is preserved in the translated Python code.
