Here's the equivalent Python code:

```py
class Foo:
    def foo(self, n):
        i = 0
        sum = 0
        while i < n: # Corrected loop direction: loop decrementor decreases the loop iterator variable i, which is expected in this case.
            sum += 1
            i -= 1
```

Note that Python does not require explicit type declarations like C#, so I removed them from the code. Also, in Python, you can use += operator to increment a variable by 1 and -= operator to decrease it by 1. Finally, instead of using for loop with decrementing loop counter, I used a while loop with decrementing loop counter to achieve the same behavior as the original C# code.
