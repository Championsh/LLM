    sf_set_trusted_sink_ptr: This function is used to mark a pointer as a trusted sink. It should be used when a pointer is passed to a function that is known to handle it safely: sf_set_trusted_sink_ptr(s);

    sf_append_string: This function is used to append one string to another. It should be used when concatenating strings to avoid potential buffer overflows: sf_append_string((char *)s, (const char *)append);

    sf_null_terminated: This function is used to ensure that a string is null-terminated. It should be used when working with strings to avoid potential buffer overflows: sf_null_terminated((char *)s);


    sf_buf_overlap: This function is used to check for potential buffer overlaps. It should be used when working with buffers to avoid potential buffer overflows: sf_buf_overlap(s, append);

    sf_set_trusted_sink_int: This function is used to mark an integer as a trusted sink. It should be used when an integer is passed to a function that is known to handle it safely: sf_set_trusted_sink_int(destlen);

    sf_buf_copy: This function is used to copy one buffer to another. It should be used when working with buffers to avoid potential buffer overflows.
    e.g. sf_buf_copy(s, append);

    sf_buf_size_limit: This function is used to set a limit on the size of a buffer. It should be used when working with buffers to avoid potential buffer overflows.
    e.g. sf_buf_size_limit(append, count);

    sf_buf_size_limit_read: This function is used to set a limit on the number of bytes that can be read from a buffer. It should be used when working with buffers to avoid potential buffer overflows.
    e.g. sf_buf_size_limit_read(append, count);

    sf_buf_stop_at_null: This function is used to ensure that a buffer stops at a null character. It should be used when working with buffers to avoid potential buffer overflows.
    e.g. sf_buf_stop_at_null(append);

    sf_strlen: This function is used to get the length of a string. It should be used when working with strings to avoid potential buffer overflows.
    e.g. sf_strlen(res, (const char *)s);

    sf_strdup_res: This function is used to duplicate a string. It should be used when working with strings to avoid potential buffer overflows.
    sf_strdup_res(res);
