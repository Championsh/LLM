Unite Static Analysis Rules for specification generation where possible: For any cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA256, SHA384, SHA512):
    Use sf_overwrite to mark the hash context as overwritten in the initialization function (e.g., SHA256_Init, SHA384_Init, SHA512_Init).
    Use sf_overwrite to mark the hash context as overwritten in the update function (e.g., SHA256_Update, SHA384_Update, SHA512_Update).
    Use sf_overwrite to mark the hash context as overwritten in the finalization function (e.g., SHA256_Final, SHA384_Final, SHA512_Final).
    In the finalization function, use sf_overwrite to mark the output digest as overwritten.
    Use sf_new to mark the hash context as newly allocated with a specific memory category (e.g., SHA256_CTX_MEMORY_CATEGORY, SHA512_CTX_MEMORY_CATEGORY) in the initialization function.
    Use sf_set_possible_null to mark the hash context as possibly null in the initialization function.
    Use sf_not_acquire_if_eq to mark the hash context as not acquired if it is equal to null in the initialization function.
    Use sf_delete to mark the hash context as freed with a specific memory category (e.g., SHA256_CTX_MEMORY_CATEGORY, SHA512_CTX_MEMORY_CATEGORY) in a cleanup function (if applicable).
    If the hash function takes a password, key, or secret as an input parameter, use sf_password_use to mark the input parameter that specifies the password, key, or secret.
    Use sf_buf_size_limit to set the buffer size limit based on the input parameter that specifies the size of the data to be hashed and any other relevant parameters.
    If the hash function copies a buffer to the allocated memory, use sf_bitcopy to mark the memory as copied from the input buffer.
    Return the output digest as the result of the hash function.
