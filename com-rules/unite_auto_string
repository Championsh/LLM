Unite Static Analysis Rules for specification generation where possible: 

    Null Pointer Check: Ensure that pointer arguments passed to functions are not null. This applies to functions like strcat, strncat, strcpy, strncpy, strchr, strrchr, strcmp, strncmp, memcmp, strcasecmp, strncasecmp, strtok, index, rindex, strdup, memset, memcpy, memmove, etc.

    Buffer Overflow Check: Ensure that the size of the buffer is sufficient to hold the data being written into it. This applies to functions like strcat, strncat, strcpy, strncpy, memset, memcpy, memmove, etc.

    Use of Safe Functions: Encourage the use of safer functions like strncat instead of strcat, strncpy instead of strcpy, etc. These functions allow the programmer to specify a maximum number of characters to be written, thus preventing buffer overflows.

    String Termination Check: Ensure that string functions like strcat, strncat, strcpy, strncpy, etc., always result in a null-terminated string.

    Memory Leak Check: Ensure that memory allocated using functions like strdup is properly freed when no longer needed.

    Input Validation: Ensure that input parameters to functions are valid. For example, in strnlen, ensure that maxlen is a positive number.

    Use of Trusted Sink Functions: Ensure that sink functions like sf_set_trusted_sink_ptr, sf_set_trusted_sink_int, sf_append_string, sf_buf_copy, sf_buf_size_limit, sf_buf_size_limit_read, sf_buf_stop_at_null, sf_null_terminated, sf_buf_overlap, etc., are used appropriately.

    Use of Sanitize Functions: Ensure that sanitize functions like sf_sanitize are used appropriately to clean input data.

    Use of Bitinit Function: Ensure that the sf_bitinit function is used appropriately to initialize data.

    Use of Overwrite Function: Ensure that the sf_overwrite function is used appropriately to overwrite data.

    Use of Assert Cond Function: Ensure that the sf_assert_cond function is used appropriately to assert conditions.

    Use of Alloc Possible Null Function: Ensure that the sf_set_alloc_possible_null function is used appropriately to indicate that a memory allocation may return null.

    Use of New Function: Ensure that the sf_new function is used appropriately to allocate new memory.

    Use of Strdup Res Function: Ensure that the sf_strdup_res function is used appropriately to indicate the result of a string duplication operation.

    Use of Transfer Tainted Function: Ensure that the sf_transfer_tainted function is used appropriately to transfer taint information from one data object to another.
