Function Name: SysAllocString Parameters: const OLECHAR* psz - Input parameter containing string data to be copied and allocated memory for. Return Value: BSTR - Pointer to newly allocated memory containing the input string data.

Description: This function allocates memory for the input string data and copies it into a new buffer, returning a pointer to the newly allocated memory. The memory allocation is performed using the BSTR_ALLOC_CATEGORY and BSTR_ALLOC_FLAG_DEFAULT flags, which specify that the string should be allocated on the default heap with normal memory management behavior. The function also ensures that the memory is overwritten with random values before use to avoid information leakage.

Note: The implementation of this function may vary depending on the programming language or platform being used, but the basic functionality and parameters should remain consistent with the given specification.
