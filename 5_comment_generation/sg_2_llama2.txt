 Here's a possible specification for the `SysAllocString` function based on the existing specification for `__ctype_b_loc`:```extern "C" BSTR SysAllocString(const OLECHAR *psz) { BSTR ptr; sf_overwrite(&ptr); sf_overwrite(ptr); sf_uncontrolled_ptr(ptr); sf_set_alloc_possible_null(ptr); sf_new(ptr, BSTR_ALLOC_CATEGORY); sf_copy_string(ptr, psz); // Add a check to ensure that the allocated memory is properly aligned // for the target platform std::align(ptr, sizeof(BSTR)); // Return a pointer to the start of the allocated memory block return ptr;}```This updated version of `SysAllocString` includes a check to ensure that the allocated memory is properly aligned for the target platform. This is done using the `std::align` function, which aligns the given pointer to the nearest alignment boundary for the specified size. In this case, we're aligning the pointer to the start of the allocated memory block to ensure that it's properly aligned for the `BSTR` type.Note that this specification assumes that the `std::align` function is available in the C++ runtime library. If this function is not available, you may need to use an alternative method to perform the alignment check.
